Holographic projection is an imaging technique in which the light beam is modulated in such
a way that not just its intensity, but also its phase can be controlled. As a result, the created
wavefronts correspond to those that would be reflected by real objects. With the use of
modern spatial light modulators, it is possible to create high-resolution colored holographic images
in real time. One of the most promising out of those devices are liquid crystal on silicon
modulators, due to the simplicity of their use, high diffraction efficiency and continuous phase
modulation.
This thesis investigates the relation between the structure of the liquid crystal pixel array of
the modulators and the image duplicates observed in the reconstructions of Fourier holograms.
The analysis proves their relation to the shape and the regular structure of said pixels. Two
solutions to the aforementioned imperfections of the holographic technology are proposed.
The primarily researched solution is the application of apodizing masks: amplitude, phase,
or of mixed nature, in order to suppress the image duplicates. Amplitude masks with a Gaussian
profile of the effective pixel were designed and fabricated. To verify the numerical results, an
experimental-set-up was created, in which a desired change in intensity distribution of Fourier
hologram reconstructions was observed. To increase the efficiency of the apodizing masks,
phase masks were considered at the next step. Simple phase masks were proposed, which
can redirect the intensity of the reconstruction beam into the area of a main image in off-axis
projection. Both binary and kinoform masks were tested in the simulations, the first of which
were tested in the experiment. Fabrication of the binary mask was attempted as well. The
potential effects of combining the amplitude and phase masks were evaluated numerically.
The possibility of decreasing the regularity of modulator pixels is discussed as well, researched
in both simulations and experiment, and suppression of image duplicates is achieved
at the cost of increased noise. Magneto-optic garnets are also suggested as a possible alternative
medium for hologram recording.
The obtained results prove the thesis that it is possible to achieve suppression of image duplicates
in Fourier hologram reconstructions from liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators,
either by randomization of the pixel structure, or by applying subpixel apodizing masks.
